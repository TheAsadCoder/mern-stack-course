## Introduction

This course is designed to teach students how to build fullstack web applications using the **MERN Stack**, which includes **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. The course starts with modern JavaScript foundations, moves into frontend development using React, covers backend development using Node.js and Express, and finally teaches database integration and deployment techniques.

By the end of the course, students will be able to build and deploy complete web applications using real world tools and technologies.

  Write custom hooks to organize logic.

- **Best Practices**  
  Folder structure, naming conventions, component reusability.

- **React Project (Frontend Only)**  
  Build a To-Do App or Weather App.

## 3. Node.js and Express.js – Backend Development

Node.js and Express.js are used to build the backend APIs and server logic for web apps.

### Topics Covered:

- **What is Node.js?**  
  A runtime environment to run JavaScript on the server.

- **Installing Node and NPM**  
  Setup environment and install required packages.

- **Creating a Basic Server**  
  Using Node’s `http` module and Express.

  - Setting up server  
  - Creating routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- **Middleware**  
  - Logging  
  - Request parsing  
  - Custom middleware functions

- **RESTful API Design**  
  Design endpoints to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.

- **Request and Response Handling**  
  Understanding `req`, `res`, and status codes.

- **Error Handling in Express**  
  Global error middleware and custom error responses.

- **Using Environment Variables**  
  Use `.env` files for storing secret keys and configurations.

- **Express Project (Backend Only)**  
  Build a simple Blog API or Product API.

## 4. MongoDB – NoSQL Database Integration

MongoDB is a document-based database used to store and manage data in real-time applications.

### Topics Covered:

- **What is MongoDB?**  
  A NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents.

- **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)**  
  - Creating an account  
  - Setting up a cluster  
  - Getting connection strings

  Define structure and constraints for your data.

- **CRUD with Mongoose**  
  - Create documents  
  - Read documents  
  - Update documents  
  - Delete documents

- **Validation and Error Handling**  
  Use Mongoose validation to ensure clean data.

- **Populating Relationships**  
  Connect and fetch data from related collections.

### Final Words for Students

The topics explained above are just a roadmap. A foundation to help you understand what this course covers.  
But in reality, this course is **much more than just a list of technologies**.

You’re not just going to **"learn React"** or **"build an API."**  
You’re going to **build real applications**, **solve real problems**, and write **production-ready code**.

**We will:**

- Create multiple hands on **projects** together  
- Explore **real-world development workflows**  
- Discuss how things are used in **actual jobs and freelance projects**  
- Learn how to **debug, deploy, and scale** your applications  
- And most importantly, **have fun while learning**

By the end of this course, you won’t just know the **MERN stack** —  
You’ll be able to **think like a developer**, **build like a professional**, and **launch like a founder**.

So get ready because this journey is going to be full of **learning, building, and growing**.
